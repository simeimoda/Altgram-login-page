## Project Description
This project is a responsive Instagram-style login and signup page built with HTML and CSS to practice web development fundamentals. Named "Altgram," it features a clean, modern design with a login form, signup form, and in-page navigation, mimicking Instagram's aesthetic. The project includes a responsive layout, custom styling, and a footer with navigation links, showcasing my skills in HTML structure and CSS design as a foundation for my journey to becoming a full-stack developer.

## What I Learned
- **In-Page Navigation**: Links between login (`index.html`) and signup (`signup.html`) pages for seamless user flow.
- **Flexbox** for responsive layout.
- **Custom Styling**: Uses CSS custom properties for colors, Flexbox for layout, and media queries for responsiveness.
- **Instagram-Inspired UI**: Includes a login page with username and password fields, a signup page with additional fields, and a "Log In with Facebook" button.
